# Infrastructure Repository

I created this repository to document and automate the setup of my development environments. Starting with my Azure-based windows development setup.

## Getting Started

1. **Prerequisites**:
    - Install Terraform
2. **Initialization**:
    - Navigate to the purpose-specific directory (e.g., `win-cloud-dev`) and run `terraform init`.
3. **Planning**:
    -   Execute `terraform plan` within the platform-specific directory to review the changes Terraform  will make.
4. **Applying**:
    - Apply the configurations using `terraform apply` to provision your infrastructure.
